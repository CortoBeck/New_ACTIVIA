This repository is a personal modified version of the original ACTIVIA package developed by John Back and Yorck Ramachers. It is based on the official ACTIVIA code for calculating cosmic-ray–induced isotope production cross-sections and yields.

In this version, I have implemented the Bateman equations to compute the time evolution of activities and to propagate decay chains, allowing the calculation of activity build-up and decay for daughter nuclei.

The original code and methodology are described in: “ACTIVIA: Calculation of isotope production cross-sections and yields”, Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A 586, 286 (2008).

This repository is independent from the original project and is intended for personal use, testing, and further development.
